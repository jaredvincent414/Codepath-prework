I tried screening recording using the kap but it Kept bringing up some errors that I needed to report I decided the tutorial given about loom and embedded my video on GitHub using it.

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
favourite apps
- Spotify - I listen to music a lot
favorite features: a personalized playlist with weekly top listened to, new releases, and concerts near me based on my listening
                  - Cross-device listening; I can control music from my iPhone and MacBook effortlessly
                  offline listening: I can download music and listen to it when I don't have access to the internet
                  
WhatsApp - It's a major form of communication for most people in my country, Kenya
 - Voice calls and video calls, I can easily reach out to my family back home at lower costs
 - Media and document sharing - we can share videos and documents easily
 - secured communication
 Tiktok 
 - TikTok allows creators to make content together (Duet)
 - E-commerce - It allows for shopping with TikTok shops
 _ FYP, the For You Page - the algorithm personalizes feeds for users making them see contents that are of importance to them
 APP Brainstorm
I would like to build an app that integrates all international money remittance services, allowing users to compare transfer exchange rates and delivery times across the
various providers, simplifying the process. I will include leading platforms like Send Wave with real-time data for exchange rates, transfer rates, and delivery times. Users
can compare providers based on exchange rates and time taken for delivery across different locations. Users will be able to create their profiles and see their transaction history, and the app can also monitor their favorite providers to ease the process. I am, however, unsure about some of the processes especially if I need permission from these providers or not. 
## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
My challenge was mostly after the building process, with the screen recording  and GIF but I managed to do it with loom.
